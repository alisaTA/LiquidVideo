    <ul>
      <li>Q. Will we have to buy new cameras or equipment?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. While there is some computing hardware needed for the system, nothing has to be replaced in your existing surveillance infrastructure and old analog cameras are fine as well.</li>
      <li>Q. How long does it take to set up?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. About 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Q. What will we have to provide to use the system?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. We’d need the following information:</li>
      <div>
        <ol >
          <li>   • The location’s GPS coordinates.</li>
          <li>   • Floor plans or schematics of the site’s structures.</li>
          <li>   • The locations of the fixed cameras within these floor plans.</li>
          <li>   • RTSP addresses of the cameras’ video feeds.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <li>Q. Does your system support radar?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. Yes. We’ve supplied our system in Baltimore with 2 radars, so it is probably the first school/community campus to be protected by radars - affordably. </li>
      <li>Q. Is the system difficult to use?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. It’s completely intuitive and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Q. Is it portable or does it have to stay in one room?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. The tablet is completely portable, even beyond the site.</li>
      <li>Q. Can police and fire use the system?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. Yes! The system is designed so that anyone using it will completely understand the situation in minutes and be able to take decisive action.</li>
      <li>Q. Does the system have a server?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. Generally yes, depending on version and the type of the deployed devices within the site.</li>
      <li>Q. Do you also do private security consulting?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. Certainly</li>
      <li>Q. For which kind of properties is this system appropriate?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. For a very wide variety of properties. From schools and community facilities, through commercial spaces and facilities and government buildings. Practically, any type of site that has to be monitored.</li>
      <li>Q. Is it possible to have more than one tablet?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. With the proper data network - The system will support as many tablets as you would like.</li>
      <li>Q. Is the system secure? Won’t it create vulnerabilities for our system?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. The system may work “under the hood” within your data network, so all your IT security suits will protect it.</li>
      <li>Q. What about privacy concerns?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. Privacy concerns are raised and dealt with during the installation of cameras. Our system does not raise any further concerns.</li>
      <li>Q. How can our guards use this system?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. Your guards can use this system as a force multiplier - it turns guards into super guards, being able to monitor the entire site from wherever they are, even out of the site.</li>
      <li>Q. Do you have any certifications?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. None is needed.</li>
      <li>Q.  Do you have remote microphone capability to the facility to warn/threaten a suspect?</li>
      <li id='header-blue'>A. The system can be added with this functionality, we’d need to know the type of PA system you have in your site so we can integrate with it.</li>
